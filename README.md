# first-phaser-project

The first project I've made using Phaser framework. It's a game where you pick up points and need to avoid the enemies 
in the increasingly difficult terrain.

In this project I've learned how to make a simple game in Phaser. How to use simple animations, particles, sounds and similar.

You can access the game here:
